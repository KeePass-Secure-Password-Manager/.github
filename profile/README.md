## 🧠 Overview

**KeePass** is a lightweight and secure password management application designed to store credentials in an encrypted local database. It provides full control over password storage without relying on cloud-based synchronization, making it ideal for users who prefer offline security.

The software keeps all login information inside a protected vault, secured by a master password or key file. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains accessible only to the user while staying safe from unauthorized access.

KeePass offers a structured interface where entries can be organized into groups and categories. It also includes tools for generating strong passwords and managing credentials efficiently across different accounts.

Optimized for Windows systems, KeePass is known for its stability, minimal resource usage, and open-source design. It is a practical solution for users who value simplicity, transparency, and full control over their password data.
